  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080
  
  # kibana3
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 9292, host: 9292
  
  # elasticsearch
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 9200, host: 9200

  # logstash

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
  #   # Don't boot with headless mode
  #   vb.gui = true
  
    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", "8"]
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "4096"]
  end
